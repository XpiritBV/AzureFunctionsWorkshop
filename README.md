# Azure Functions Workshop 

Welcome to the Azure Functions Workshop! This repo contains some lessons and source code which helps you learn the basics of .NET Core based Azure Functions and related Azure services.

You will build a modern web application, using Azure Functions and .NET 6. Once completed, you will create Azure infrastructure by using the `az` cli, and run the app in the Cloud.

## Required knowledge

Even though this is an introductory workshop, you will need to bring some experience using C# and a basic understanding of the resource model of Azure.

## What you will learm

In the workshop, you will learn how to create an Azure Function app, that uses a number of Azure components to calculate score. You get introduced to queues, table storage, signalR and appservices inside Azure. We will also show you how to provision this application in the cloud as well by creating the needed infrastructure and deploying it.
